## Overview
### Description
Kitsu-iOS is an iOS client for the popular anime website [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/)

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment / Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app provides a real-time discussion section for each anime.
- **Story:** We wants to make this app so that anyone can find anime that fits individual preference, and engage in discussion forum.
- **Market:** The users are anime fans around the world. The value to the users is that they can engage in the community real-time, and find anime that they like easily.
- **Habit:** We hope that this app can be used on daily basis for some people as they engage in anime discussion a lot.
- **Scope:** The main function of this app is recommending anime for each user, which is similar to Flix. So, it will not be too challenging to implement the core function. Another function we want to implement is discussion forum for each anime. This involves messaging feature, which we have not implemented. This part could be the most challenging for us.
